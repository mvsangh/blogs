    "Hey there! Iâ€™m a Cybersecurity Automation Engineer with a strong background in Linux systems, cloud security, and building EDR solutions. I love working with open source tools and creating smart, efficient ways to detect and respond to threats. My work often involves tools like Wazuh, Osquery, and Suricata, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve and automate security operations. When Iâ€™m not deep in logs or scripts, youâ€™ll find me experimenting with new security stacks or sharing what Iâ€™ve learned through writing and projects.",
